Are individuals more aggressive towards stronger or weaker opponents during competition? I attempted to answer this question using 121,332 chess games from [Lichess (an open-source chess server)](http://www.lichess.org). 

- Each player in chess has an rating that corresponds to their skill level, relative to others in the same rating pool. Lichess uses the Glicko 2 system to compute ratings, which is said to be an improvement over the Elo system, meaning that all players start with a rating of 1500. The ratings then increase after wins and decrease after losses. 
- Players, particularly those at intermediate levels and above, tend to also have repertoires of openings (i.e., the starting moves of games that have been worked out to "optimality" by either expert chess players or computers). Such openings can range from more to less agressive, with agressive options like the King's Gambit typically requiring players to sacrifice pieces in exchange for a more aggresive/attack-oriented position.
